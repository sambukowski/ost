IN PROGRESS: Tabs
    - should the save and load buttons always be present on all tabs?
    IN PROGRESS: Timer Tab
        - The input interface
        - TODO: add OSI item toggle?
            - this will likely be really similar to "on screen time" vs "in sceen time"
            - but controlled with similar things to the event?
            - should you be able to hide this?
    IN PROGRESS: Exporter Tab
        - The export interface
    TODO: Setup Tab
        - A UI that is specifically designed for inputing names and individual character events
        - Let's you build a list of all the events a charater might experience in film
            - i.e.: born, died, banished, "got the ring" etc.
    - need input controls when on different tabs 
        - when in export, the global timer stops, hotkeys will be different, ect
IN PROGRESS: Navigation bar
    done: Toggle OSI names from aligned-left to aligned-right
    done: live sorting buttons
    TODO: toggle OSI event visability
    TODO: control the activel OSTP in the Timer
TODO: you can load several different OSTPs at the same time and merge
    - This is primarily an Export feature
    - If you load multiple OSTPs at once when in the Timer, need to add a section in the NavBar that let's you control only one at a time
TODO: Single character on screen plot
    - load multiple OSTPs the chose one character from all of them to compare screen time
TODO: on screen time and in scene time
    - simultanious info that let's you track when someone is specificly on screen or in the scene
    - probably need to integrate a player into the OST
    - get to frame level accuracy for on screen (because someone will ask for it)
    - do the same for in scene 
TODO: hot keys
    - allow for toggling on and off OSIs with keyboard keys
    - the hotkeys will always stay the same even if the order of the OSIs changes
TODO: have tab key show the hotkeys for all items on screen 
    - or just what the controls are in general?
        - maybe another tab
    - like the overwatch team info screen
TODO: when exporting you can choose to only export specific OSIs
TODO: when you hover over an OSI it shows what "time" the cursor is additonal
TODO: for export options, combine OSIs
    - for instance Batman/Bruce Wayne can get combined into "one"
    - just one color? or keep the original colors
IN PROGRESS: Update OSI order: for the TIMER
    done: buttons or...
        > can sort by the following:    
            - percent screen time: ascending and decending
            - most or least recently on screen 
            - alphabetically: ascending and decending
    cancled: drag and drop OSIs?
        - this would be better than buttons?
        > i don't think the manual sorting while timing is nesseary
        > this feature has been moved to the exporter

TODO: the OST header should be styled like the credits in Fight Club
    - white letters, blue shadow, correct font
TODO: global cursor? - in the editor
    - ititially let you go back and figure out events
    - go back and update screen time later
    - EDIT mode? toggle what things can be changed and whatnot with a button that appears?
TODO: OSI EVENTS
    - basically soundcloud timed comments 
    - thin bar below header, add button in the same spot as the color picker?

    TODO: manually being able to set the order of the OSIs
    TODO: needs a "nothing is tracked" option to add an additonal bar
    TODO: choose to show the names or not
