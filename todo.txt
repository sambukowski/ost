    - should the save and load buttons always be present on all tabs?
    - Timer Tab
        - The input interface
    - Exporter Tab
        - The export interface
    - need input controls when on different tabs 
        - when in export, the global timer stops, hotkeys will be different, ect
TODO: you can load several different OSTPs at the same time and merge
TODO: Single character on screen plot
    - load multiple OSTPs the chose one character from all of them to compare screen time
TODO: on screen time and in scene time
    - simultanious info that let's you track when someone is specificly on screen or in the scene
    - probably need to integrate a player into the OST
    - get to frame level accuracy for on screen (because someone will ask for it)
    - do the same for in scene 
TODO: hot keys
    - allow for toggling on and off OSIs with keyboard keys
    - the hotkeys will always stay the same even if the order of the OSIs changes
TODO: have tab key show the hotkeys for all items on screen 
    - or just what the controls are in general?
        - maybe another tab
    - like the overwatch team info screen
TODO: when exporting you can choose to only export specific OSIs
TODO: when you hover over an OSI it shows what "time" the cursor is additonal
TODO: for export options, combine OSIs
    - for instance Batman/Bruce Wayne can get combined into "one"
    - just one color? or keep the original colors
TODO: Update OSI order:
    TODO: buttons or...
    TODO: drag and drop OSIs?
        - this would be better than buttons?
TODO: the png export should sort OSIs by percent screen time from top down
TODO: the exporter is on a different tab?
    - i should figure out tabs in general
TODO: the OST header should be styled like the credits in Fight Club
    - white letters, blue shadow, correct font
